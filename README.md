`pullomatic` automates GIT repository synchronisation.

Storing configuration or other application data in a GIT repository is a common practice.
Usually custom scripts are used to pull updates from remote from time to time.
`pullomatic` replaces these scripts with pure configuration.

Beside the polling interval, `pullomatic` provides a HTTP endpoint which can be used to trigger updates by web-hooks.

Whenever a change is detected in the remote repository branch, the new branch head will be checked out to the path.

## Configuration

Each repository is configured in a single file which must be placed inside `/etc/pullomatic/`.
The filename is used as repository name and must be formatted as TOML file.

The main section must contain a `path` which specifies the path where the repository lives.
On startup, the existence of the repository will checked.
If the repository does not exists, the remote repository will be cloned to that path.
Second, the config must contain a `remote_url` and a `remote_branch` which specifies the remote URL of the GIT repository and the branch to check out.

The following options are allowed in the configuration:

| Option | Type | Required | Description |
| ------ | ---- | -------- |----------- |
| `path` | `str` | ✓ | Path to the GIT repository on disk |
| `remote_url` | `str` | ✓ | Remote URL of the GIT repository to pull changes from |
| `remote_branch` | `str` | ✓ | The branch to check out and pull changes from |

### Credentials
The configuration can contain a `credentials` section depending on the transport type used to connect to the remote GIT server.

Usually, the `remote_url` contains a username if one is required to authenticate.
As a fallback, a `username` can be specified in this section.

If the SSH or HTTP(S) transport is used, the section can contain a `password` which is used to authenticate agains the remote server.

For SSH, a key pair can be used as an alternative.
Therefore, a `private_key` must be specified containing the SSH private key (as generated by `ssh-keygen`).
Additionally, a `passphrase` can be specified which is used to unlock the key.
If a `public_key` is given, it will not be derived from the private key, but the given one will be used.

### Interval
The check the repository regularly for changes, the configuration con contain a `interval` section.
If this section is present, it must contain a `interval` parameter, which specifies the interval to poll for changes.
The format of this option allows to specify the interval in multiple ways like `30sec` or `5m` (See [here](https://docs.rs/humantime/1.1.1/humantime/fn.parse_duration.html) for more details).
